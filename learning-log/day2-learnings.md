# Day 2: Interfaces

## Key Concepts
- Interfaces define the shape of objects
- Similar to Pydantic models in Python
- Used for React component props
- Can have optional properties (?)
- Can have readonly properties
- Can extend other interfaces

## Connection to FAROS
- Backend: Pydantic validates API data
- Frontend: Interfaces validate component props
- Both prevent bugs by enforcing types

## Practice Problems Completed
1. [Problem name] - [What I learned]
2. [Problem name] - [What I learned]
...

## React Connection
- Component props are interfaces
- State can be typed with interfaces
- Same pattern as backend validation

## What Clicked
- [Something that made sense]

## Still Unclear
- [Something to review tomorrow]

## Tomorrow's Focus
- More React with TypeScript
- Practice typing useState
- Maybe start planning FAROS types
